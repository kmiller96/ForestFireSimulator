# Forest Fire Simulator
A terminal-based toy which simulates the way forest fires burn. Just a hypnotic
application which is fun to watch for a few minutes. Inspired by the similar
application in the game Super Hot.

## Requirements
The only requirement for this application for python 3.x to be installed. The
code was tested on python version 3.7

Only vanilla python was used - no additional installations necessary!


## Configuration
You can easily change your simulation based upon your own preferences. You can
tweak the values in the `config.ini` file and see how that effects your 
simulation. 

If you'd like to remove a part of the engine entirely just switch the `use` key
to `no` instead of the default `yes`.


## Running
You can call the main entrypoint of the application:

```bash
python run.py
```

and that will start the simulation. You can leave the simulation at any time
by pressing the "q" key.
